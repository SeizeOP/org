#+description: A personal outline of Firefox configuration for security and privacy.

* Firefox Configuration Guide
** My Configuration :My:Configuration:
This guide is intended to outline my current Firefox configuration; including security hardening and style configuration. Since a complete Firefox configuration can be rather complex; this guide has been separated into three sections (Settings, Extensions & Themes, and Manual Configuration). This separation of topics will help to clarify the purpose of any instructions in each section.

*** Settings
**** General
***** Startup
- Open previous windows & tabs: Disabled
***** Tabs
- Ctrl+Tab cycles through tabs in recently used order: Enabled
- Open links in tabs instead of new windows: Enabled
- Confirm before quitting with Ctrl+Q: Enabled
***** Browsing
- Recommend extensions as you browse: Disabled
- Recommend features as you browse: Disabled
**** Home
***** New Windows & Tabs
- Homepage & New windows: Tabliss
- New Tabs: Tabliss
***** Firefox Home Content
Since Tabliss is in use these settings don't matter that much. However these are still the recommended settings.
- Web Search: Enabled
- Shortcuts: Enabled | 1 row
  - Sponsored shortcuts: Disabled
- Recommended by Pocket: Disabled
- Recent activity: Disabled
- Snippets: Disabled
**** Search
***** Search Bar
- Add search bar in toolbar: Enabled
***** Default Search Engine
- [[https://search.brave.com/][Brave Search]]
  There are various privacy respecting search/meta-search engines available. This selection comes down to personal preference. Just make sure to pick something other than Google or Bing.
***** Search Suggestions
- Provide search suggestions: Disabled
**** Privacy & Security
- Enhanced Tracking Protection: Strict[fn:1]
- Cookies & Site Data: Delete cookies and site data when Firefox is closed: checked
- Logins and Passwords: Uncheck all[fn:2]
- History: Never remember history
- Address Bar - Firefox Suggest: Suggestions from the web: disabled
- Address Bar - Firefox Suggest: Suggestions from sponsors: disabled
- Firefox Data Collection and Use: Uncheck all
- Enable HTTPS-Only Mode in all windows
**** Sync
Not enabled
- Contents are E2EE[fn:0]; so not a security/privacy issue. However only usefull if Firefox is installed on multiple devices.
*** Extensions & Themes
**** Extensions
Extensions can increase attack surface, have privileged access in browser, requiring developer trust. For this reason it is reccommended to keep extensions to a minimum.
***** Tabliss
Used to replace the default new tab and home pages in Firefox with a more user friendly layout and style. This is a personal choice for consistency; generally only Ublock Origin and maybe the extension for your chosen password manager is reccommended.

There are probably other sites/guides that influenced this write-up, however are the two I remember.

* Footnotes
[fn:0] End to End Encrypted
[fn:1] I have never known this setting to cause any website breakage, however you can always change it back to Standard or Custom if you do.
[fn:2] There is malware capable of swiping data stored in your browser, including history and saved passwords, credit cards, and even multi-factor authentication cookies. You can choose to leave cookies and other sign-in data and history if you want, but know that it is a security risk.
[fn:3] See the [[https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/wiki/Blocking-mode][Wiki]] for further explanation of Ublock Origin's blocking modes.
[fn:4] On my main system [[https://fedoraproject.org/spins/sway/][Fedora Sway]] I use the Dracula gtk theme to provide a fairly universal UI/UX computing experience.
